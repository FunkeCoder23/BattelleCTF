To my next Dwarf victim:

I knew you would be back and my hunch regarding your greed was correct.  As you look around you here all you’ll find is junk. My magic portal is protected by a secret password you’ll never discover and my metallurgical skills are unmatched even by you Dwarves!

You might as well give up now before I catch whiff of you and wake up for a Dwarf-kabob.

Sincerely yours,
Bronze Dragon
